# Floquet Theorem Implementation in C++

## Overview
This repository contains the numerical implementation of the Floquet theorem, specifically using the extended Hilbert space method. The implementation focuses on a system modeled by the spin-1 Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian for a single particle. However, the approach can be adapted to other quantum systems as well.

## Background
The techniques implemented here were developed as part of an undergraduate thesis in Physics. They are designed to explore and solve the dynamics of quantum systems under periodic driving, leveraging the extended Hilbert space to manage time-dependent Hamiltonians effectively.

## Potential Applications
While the current implementation is tailored to the spin-1 Bose-Hubbard model, it can be extended or modified to suit a variety of quantum systems exhibiting periodic behavior. Researchers and students might find this implementation useful as a starting point for similar or more complex systems.

## Updates and Improvements
The codebase is under continuous review for enhancements:
- **Documentation Updates**: Efforts are ongoing to improve comments and documentation within the code for better understanding and ease of use.
- **Feature Expansion**: Future updates may include more generic interfaces to handle a broader range of quantum systems.

## Getting Started
To get started with this implementation, clone the repository and review the code comments for guidance on setup and execution.
